# 🔐 WhatsApp Desktop Lock (Works On Prev. Versions only)

A clean and seamless **overlay lock screen** for WhatsApp Desktop, built using **Python + CustomTkinter**.  
Protects your chats whenever WhatsApp is opened in the foreground.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Blur Overlay Lock Screen** — prevents interaction until password is entered  
- **WhatsApp UI Themed Design** — visually fits the native app  
- **Password Visibility Toggle** — subtle, smooth transitions  
- **Foreground Detection** — lock triggers only when WhatsApp is active  
- **Auto-Unlock Session** — stays unlocked until WhatsApp is closed  
- **Lightweight** — almost no CPU usage
- **Optional Auto-Start at Login** — runs silently in background

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Script runs in the background.
2. Detects when **WhatsApp Desktop** becomes the active window.
3. Displays a **blurred overlay lock** requiring password entry.
4. Once correct password is entered:
   - Overlay disappears
   - WhatsApp is usable normally until closed.

## ▶️ Run

```bash
python main.py
```

---

## 🚀 Optional: Auto-Start on Windows Login

1. Build executable:

   ```bash
   pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile --add-data "ui/assets;ui/assets" --add-data "pass.txt;." main.py
   ```

2. Place shortcut of the generated `.exe` in (Startup Folder):

   ```
   Win + R → shell:startup     
   ```
   
3. If the above method doesn't work then try:

   🔄 Enable Auto-Start (Recommended)

   To make WhatsApp Lock launch automatically when you log in to Windows, set it up using Task Scheduler.
  
  1) Open Task Scheduler
        ```
         Win + R → taskschd.msc → Enter
        ```
  2) Create a New Task     
        - Click Action → Create Task
        - Name it: `WhatsApp Lock`
        - Enable:
            - ✅ Run only when user is logged on
            - ✅ Run with highest privileges
  3) Add Trigger      
        - Go to the Triggers tab → New
        - Begin the task: At log on
        - User: Select your account
        - Click OK      
  4) Add Action      
        - Go to the Actions tab → New
        - Action: Start a program
        - Program/script: Select your .bat launcher file
        - Click OK
  5) Adjust Conditions (Important for Laptops) 
        - Go to the Conditions tab
        - Uncheck:
          Start only if the computer is on AC power 
  6) Save 
        - Click OK
        - Close Task Scheduler
  
  ✅ Now WhatsApp Lock will automatically run silently every time you log in.
